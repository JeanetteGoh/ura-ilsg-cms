<b>Tree Man </b><br>
ENESS (Australia)<br>
<b>Location:</b> Event Square
<br><br>

Encircling a sapling in his arms, <i>Tree Man</i> provides sanctuary for a young tree while carving out an inner sanctum for visitors. The act of nurturing and connecting with our environment is emphasised in the whimsical light sculptures.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Emitting blue light and with a head shaped like a digital screen, the sculpture invites reflection on humans’ insatiable preoccupation with devices, which could be detrimental to our circadian rhythms. As the light responds to movement and switches between blue and green, one wonders if we can ever find a balance between the digital and natural world?&nbsp;
<br><br>
A soundscape is overlaid with a recording of the surrounding environment and programmed to replay every hour. This mechanism mimics how social media is often an archive of ‘live recordings’ that overlap with our immediate realities.
