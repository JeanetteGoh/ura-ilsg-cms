<i>the things left unsaid</i> is a manifestation of the artistâ€™s unspoken thoughts and feelings about growing up in a time of seemingly never-ending doom. Repeatedly confronted by news of a gloomy future and an impending climate catastrophe, the artwork acts as a refuge from despair.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Visitors are encouraged to wander among wave sheets draped across the space, gently touching them to see the lights react and change. This interaction evokes an innocent sense of beauty and enchantment, and is a quiet reminder of hope, possibilities, and an appreciation for all things wonderful.
