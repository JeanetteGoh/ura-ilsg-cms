<b>Light Anemones</b><br>

Studio Kebbel (Germany)<br>
<b>Location:</b> The apex at The Promontory at Marina Bay<br><br>

<i>Light Anemones</i> is a versatile light sculpture that evolves with time and space.&nbsp;
<br><br>
During the day, its surroundings and sunlight are reflected in the curved titanium-stainless steel mirrors. In the night, linear beams appear due to the play of light along the entire concave and convex structure with a rotating centre. As light from the three sculptures interact with one another, merging with mirrored silhouettes of their neighbouring buildings, people and landscape, a complex symphony of light and imagery is composed â€” as though from a different time continuum.<br><br>

<b>About the Artist</b>
<br>
Malte Kebbel is a German artist who creates large-scale light and sculpture installations for public spaces.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Kebbel's current work focuses on questioning our evolving relationship with urban space, light, nature and energy. He uses lighting technologies, synthetic materials, parametric design and 3D technology to create monumental structures with geometric shapes and patterns reminiscent of nature.&nbsp; His installations are like temporary temples, shrines and places of contemplation that give new meanings to urban space and create new connections.</p>
