Blue energy is harnessed from the chemical potential of a salinity difference between the sea and river waters. <i>Blumiwave</i> is an interpretation of this renewable energy source.

Seen from afar, sculptural waves appear to crash at varying heights and directions. Upon closer inspection, these are in fact made of a carefully weaved fabric of safety nets and scaffolding â€” everyday objects that the interior designers at DP Design encounter at construction sites. Here, the team transforms what are normally perceived as unsightly materials into a space that invites multiple interpretations of the mundane and its possibilities.
