<b>Location:</b> Mist Walk<br><br>
<i>Symphony 1</i> is a light-based architectural entity that inhabits space. A living being, its ethereal and translucent organic form populates any location.<br><br>
Masses of twisting vine-like structures emit an icy glow to fill the space before sprouting into sprigs of crystalline flowers. The sprawl of its existence is a comment on nature and our relationship with it, contradicting yet also enhancing the brutal denseness of urban spaces it finds itself in.
