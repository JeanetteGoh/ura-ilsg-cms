<p style="font-size:17px; line-height:40px">A key component of the Festivalâ€™s sustainability efforts since its inception in 2010, the <b><i>Switch Off, Turn Up (SOTU)</i></b> campaign rallies building owners, corporations and businesses around Marina Bay and beyond to reduce their energy consumption by switching off non-essential lightings and turning up their air conditioning temperatures. Stakeholders are encouraged to continue with these energy-saving habits beyond the Festival period.
<br><br>
For the first time this year, the initiative will expand beyond corporations to include schools and the general public. 
<br><br>
Take part in <i>SOTU</i> through <i>i Light i Pledge, presented by Alibaba Cloud</i> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.susgain.com/iLightiPledge">https://www.susgain.com/iLightiPledge</a> today!
