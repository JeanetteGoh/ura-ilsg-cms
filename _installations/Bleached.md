Berenice Chao Zong Xin, Nicky Josephine Tjandra&nbsp;
<br>
Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media (Singapore)&nbsp;
<br>
		<b>Location</b>: South Beach Avenue – Level B1M&nbsp; (beside Akira Back)
<br><br>
<i>Co-presented by South Beach Consortium, Aedas, &amp; Sunray Woodcraft Construction, supported by JW Marriott Singapore South Beach</i><br><br>

<i>Bleached</i> connotes the fate of marine ecosystems affected by climate change and human activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
Simulating the experience of walking on a seabed, this artwork invites visitors to wander through an illuminated seascape adorned with ‘seaweed’ and ‘corals’. These are either made from seaweed bioplastics developed by the artists themselves, or upcycled from single-use plastics. The ‘reefs’ turn white temporarily when they sense movement and contact, alluding to coral bleaching caused by global warming and providing a stark reminder of how our actions can impact the environment.

	<b>About the Artists</b><br>
Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, Berenice Chao and Nicky Tjandra create works focused on interactivity and multimedia.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Art and design is a universal language for Chao, who aspires to evoke a sense of amusement through her works. Tjandra, trained in Traditional Fine Arts, is fascinated with abstract concepts and tactile objects.&nbsp;
<br><br>
Currently pursuing Bachelor of Fine Arts in Design Art (Interactive Design major) at Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design and Media, the duo aims to make art accessible to the community.
