What does one usually think about in the shower?&nbsp;
<br><br>
Inspired by a belief that showers are perfect settings for self-contemplation, Show III is an invitation to unwind outdoors by soaking in its calming blue light, with the company of a composed soundscape and virtual water droplets.&nbsp;
<br><br>
The act of showering without water serves as a reminder for visitors to re-evaluate their water usage. It also aims to provide an alternative environment where one can be free of worries in the bustle of the city.
