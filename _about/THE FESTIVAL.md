i Light Singapore is Asiaâ€™s leading sustainable light festival held in Marina Bay. </p>

These artworks are designed with energy-saving lightings and/or environmentally-friendly materials to encourage festival goers and the general public to adopt sustainable habits in their everyday lives. The Festival also features a diverse range of fringe activities for visitors to enjoy, bringing vibrancy to public spaces in our city centre.</p>
