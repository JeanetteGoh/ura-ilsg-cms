The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is Singapore's land use planning and conservation agency. Our mission is "to make Singapore a great city to live, work and play". We strive to create an endearing home and a vibrant and sustainable city through long-term planning and innovation, in partnership with the community.

URA’s multi-faceted role includes being the main government land sales agent. We attract and channel private capital investments to develop sites that support planning, economic and social objectives. We also partner the community to enliven our public spaces to create a car-lite, people-friendly and liveable city for all to enjoy. In shaping a distinctive city, URA also promotes architecture and urban design excellence.
